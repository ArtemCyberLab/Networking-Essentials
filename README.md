The project I implemented was focused on studying the basics of computer networks. During the work on it, I learned about several key protocols and technologies that ensure the operation of networks.

DHCP is a protocol that allows devices to automatically configure network settings when connecting to a network. I studied the process of packet exchange between the client and the server, which includes four stages: Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge.

ARP is a protocol necessary for devices to find the MAC address of a device based on its IP address. This is important for correctly forming an Ethernet frame for data transmission.

ICMP is used for network connection diagnostics. I explored the ping and traceroute commands, which help check the availability of devices in the network and determine the route of packets.

NAT allows devices in a private network to use a single public IP address to access the internet, which helps save IP addresses.

During the process, I learned how to use various tools to analyze network traffic, such as tshark and ping, to understand how devices interact within a network. This gave me valuable knowledge for working with networks in real-world conditions.
